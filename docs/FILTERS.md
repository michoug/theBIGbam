# Filtering logic

The Filtering section lets you build complex queries to narrow down which contig/sample pairs are displayed in your plots.

Each filter row consists of:

- A **category**: Contig, Sample, Coverage, Misassembly, Microdiversity, Side misassembly, Topology, or Termini

- A **metric** within that category: examples "Contig length" for Contig, "Coverage mean" for Coverage, "Sequencing type" for Sample

- A **comparison operator**: "=", "!=", ">" and "<" for numeric columns, "=" and "!=" for text columns

- An **input value**: a numeric value for numeric columns, or a text value for other columns. For text inputs, a list of existing column values is provided as autocomplete suggestions

- A **"-" button** to remove the filter row

Multiple conditions can be added within a section (visually grouped by a green bar on the left) using the green "+ Add AND/OR" button.

Multiple sections can be added using the pink "+ Add AND/OR" button.

Clicking "+ Add AND/OR" adds a new **connector** and a new **filter row**. You can choose whether the logical operator is **AND** or **OR**.

<img title="" src="../static/FILTERING.png" alt="image" data-align="center" width="323">

This two-level grouping allows expressive compound queries. For example, the example above is equivalent to the condition:

*(Contig_length > 50kbp AND Sequencing_type = "long") OR (Aligned_fraction > 70% OR Circularising_reads > 10)*

Once your filters are set, the available contigs and samples update accordingly, and only matching pairs will appear in the generated plots. This is particularly useful for focusing your analysis on subsets of interest, such as high-coverage contigs, specific packaging mechanisms, or contigs meeting completeness thresholds.

Complementary information from other modules can further confirm misassemblies or biologically meaningful subpopulations. The Coverage module provides supporting evidence: local peaks and troughs in primary reads depth often reflect such events. The presence of secondary or supplementary alignments suggests repeated regions within a contig or similarity to another contig. Signals from the Paired-Reads module further refine interpretation. An increase in read insert size indicates that genomic segments may be missing from the reference, whereas a sharp decrease suggests additional sequence in some reads. Non-inward read pairs may indicate inversions, while missing mates point to incomplete assembly. Reads whose mates map to a different contig suggest a relationship between contigs, either due to shared genomic regions or because one represents the continuation of the other in the organism’s genome.

## Side misassembly

Evaluates completeness at contig extremities based on significant clipping events (>= 50% prevalence) where the median clipped length extends beyond the contig boundary.

| Metric                               | Definition                                                                                                                        |

| Coverage_first_position              | Raw coverage (read depth) at the first position of the contig (before RLE compression)                                            |
| Contig_start_collapse_prevalence     | Prevalence of the terminal left-clipping event (clippings / local coverage), i.e. fraction of reads that are clipped at the start |

| Normalized_contig_end_misjoint_mates | Contig_end_misjoint_mates normalized by coverage mean (paired-read only)                                                          |

**Warnings:**

- Side completeness metrics tend to **underestimate the incompleteness of the contig**, especially when using short reads. Short reads cannot extend far beyond the last properly assembled base, so collapse prevalence and expansion bp are typically slightly lower than the true values. The **collapse bp**, in particular, can be substantially smaller than the actual missing sequence.

- For circular contigs, completeness values can sometimes **overestimate missing sequence**. This typically occurs when mappings are performed without theBIGbam or without the `--circular` option, **because reads that would normally span the junction between the last and first contig positions are clipped: standard mappers do not support circular alignments**.

- In **rare cases**, this effect can also occur for long reads even when the `--circular` option is used. For example, in bacteriophages, single long reads may contain multiple full viral genomes due to concatemers. In such cases, only the portion of the read corresponding to one contig length (or up to twice the contig length when mapping with theBIGbam and the `--circular` option) is mapped, and the remaining sequence is clipped. If many concatemer-derived long reads are present, incompleteness metrics may detect this clipped signal, leading to artificially high estimates of missing sequence.

## Topology

Evaluates the circularity of contigs. Circularity can only be reliably assessed when the `--circular` option is used.

| Metric                              | Definition                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Circularising_reads                 | Number of reads whose alignment starts near the end of the contig and continues past the contig start     |
| Circularising_reads_prevalence      | Circularising reads divided by the mean coverage at the first and last contig positions                   |
| Circularising_inserts               | Number of read pairs spanning the junction between contig end and start (paired-read only)                |
| Circularising_insert_size_deviation | Median insert size of circularising pairs minus median insert size of all proper pairs (paired-read only) |
| Normalized_circularising_inserts    | Circularising_inserts normalized by coverage mean (paired-read only)                                      |

An approximate estimate of circularity could be derived from mappings performed without the `--circular` option, using supplementary alignments spanning both contig ends and, for paired-end short reads, non-inward read pairs with reasonable insert sizes mapping to both contig ends. However, this approach does not provide an exact estimation of circularity compared to circular mapping with the `--circular` option. For this reason, circularity is not estimated in this case.
