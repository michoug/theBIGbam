# Database command control

### Updating the database

Example command:

```sh
thebigbam add-variable examples/outputs/HK97/HK97.db test bars "#f60820" "Test Bar" examples/inputs/HK97/variable_test.csv
thebigbam add-variable examples/outputs/HK97/HK97.db test2 curve "#aef1c2" "Test Curve" examples/inputs/HK97/variable_test2.csv
```

Database compression

For each sample, Rust computations are performed for all contigs detected as present in the BAM file (i.e., those exceeding the --min_aligned_fraction and --min_coverage_depth thresholds). After computation, the final database is further reduced through a compression step. Coverage metrics are compressed using run-length encoding (RLE): consecutive positions with similar values (within the --compress_ratio threshold) are stored as a single entry, preserving the overall signal while drastically reducing storage size. For phagetermini and assemblycheck metrics, values are compared to the local coverage and discarded if they fall below the --compress_ratio threshold, ensuring that only meaningful peaks are retained. When consecutive positions remain after filtering, RLE is applied to group them.

The output is a DuckDB database containing all computed values. This database is typically ~1000× smaller than the original BAM files while retaining the essential characteristics of the mapping data.
